## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Using your defined models (one example below), create an ERD with the relationships identified.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    category = models.ForeignKey(
        "Category", null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    description = models.TextField()
    has_sizes = models.BooleanField(default=False, null=True, blank=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    rating = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
    image_url = models.URLField(max_length=1024, null=True, blank=True)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dougyb83/tech-treasures)
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
   - `git clone https://github.com/dougyb83/tech-treasures.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dougyb83/tech-treasures)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dougyb83/tech-treasures)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
