## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contact | test_forms.py | 100% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test/py-test-contact.png) |

## Bugs

- Python - `UnorderedObjectListWarning: Pagination may yeild inconsistant results`

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I added a Meta class to the Product Class in products/models.py that ordered the products.

- Python - Pagination not keeping category filter
    - pagination would work correctly when viewing all product but when adding a category filter to a page pagination would default back to viewing all products without the category filters applied.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, it was necessary to get the current params from the url and concatenate it to the pagination param in order to correctly paginate through the filtered products.

- Python `'TypeError'` when trying to register a new account on Heroku

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04-2.png)

    - To fix this, I found a solution on slack to inlude a runtime.txt file in the root directory to specify which version of Python Heroku should use.

- HTML - Product optiions not being added to the basket
    - A bug was found when adding a second item to the basket where the second item is the same as the first item but with a different option selected (For example a 4GB and 8GB option).
What I discovered is that although the default option was highlighted, the radio button was not checked by default. This meant that if an item was added to the basket while leaving the default option highlighed the item was added but with no value for the option supplied. When a duplicate item was added but with an option highlighted and checked it created a conflict.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03-2.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03-3.png)

    - To fix this, when the radio buttons are being populated on product_details.html by the jinja for loop, I added an if statement that adds the `checked` attribute on the first iteration of that loop.

- HTML - Number of product per page does not show when product list is only one page long.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05-2.png)

    - To fix this, I added an else statement to the template logic that handles displaying the product count per page. The logic previously only handled lists that were greater than one page long.

- HTML `Duplicate attribute id`
    - A duplicate `id` was discovered during HTML validation. On further inspection using 'view page source' in the browser and checking the relevant code in my repository I found that I was manually dreating an `id` on the input element of the custom_clearable_file_input.html. However in that same element I am using an include for django form widgets, this include was also dynamically adding an `id` of its own; creating the duplicate.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06-1.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06-2.png) ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06-3.png) 

    - To fix this, I removed the `id` I had added and instead I targeted the `id` created by the include.


## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
